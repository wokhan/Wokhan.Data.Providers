# DataProviderMemberDefinition.ExclusionGroup property

An exclusion group is used to group properties that defines similar configuration items. For instance, one could have a "ConnectionString" exclusion group, with only one property directly containing the said connection string, and then a "Details" goup, containing separated values for the connection string, allowing to specify them independently.

```csharp
public string? ExclusionGroup { get; set; }
```
