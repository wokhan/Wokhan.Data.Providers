# Wokhan.Data.Providers
The base classes and interfaces used by a standardized data providing logic I needed, based on (and extending) IQueryable for multiple heterogeneous datasources.

Mainly used in a tool I'll publish soon (for real this time ðŸ˜†).

# Documentation 
Please check [the generated documentation](docs/generated/Wokhan.Data.Providers.md) to navigate through the classes.

# Note
Tests are almost empty and should be improved.
